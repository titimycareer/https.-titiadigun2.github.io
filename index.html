							<p>
							</p>Objective</p>		
						</p>As an analyst for Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has a very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. Our task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of the segment based on the provided criteria.</p>

					</p>Context</p>
					</p>The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviours. They assume they can’t target everyone using the same methods, and they’re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have effect on the sales of their products.</p>

				</p>Questions from sales and marketing team</p>
			</p>1.	What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day?</p>
		</p>2.	What hours were most money spent?</p>
	</p>3.	Are certain types of products more popular than others?</p>
</p>4.	What is the analysis of the types of customers based on?</p>
</p>5.	What is the customers’ loyalty?</p>
</p>6.	Which region are the most loyal customers?</p>
</p>7.	The age and family status of the loyal customers?</p>
</p>8.	The demographic classification of the loyal customers?</p>

								</p>Challenges</p>									
								</p>1.	While working with large sets of data Jupyter Notebook slowed down dramatically and didn’t produce necessary outputs.</p>	
							</p>Solution: After doing some research and talking to my tutor, I have learned my computer setting weren’t allowing Anaconda and Python libraries to update. I had to reinstall all the tools again to proceed with my analysis.</p>
							</p>2.	Towards the end of my project, I wanted to look at how pupolar each department is among customers. However, I only had the department Id’s in the merged dataset.</p>
							</p>Solution: I have to pull the departments datasets and merge with products_orders dataset to replace department_id with the department names.</p>
						</p>3.	Test customer datasets provided by CareerFoundry had the same customer numbers in each State within the US. This makes it difficult to analyze which States have more customers than the other and this caused a data measurement bias.</p>
						</p>Solution: I did not analyze customer’s numbers based on their states, they were measured in regions.</p>
						</p></p>	
					</p>Some of the findings.</p>
				</p>Loyal customers order every 6days.</p>
			</p>Most orders are ordered between 9.00am & 5.00pm</p>
		</p>Loyal customers order every 6days</p>
		</p>Produce is the most popular department</p>

			</p>I would recommend that Instacart run the ads in the middle of the week to encourage morders to be place. Maybe run ads for products of pets, alcohol and international products as they are one of the list products. Also Ads can be run from 9.00pm to 6.00am to boost more sales.</p>

</p></p>
</p></p>
</p>1.	Introduction</p>
</p>. Overview: The United States has an influenza season where more people than usual suffer from flu. Some people, particularly those in vulnerable populations develop serious complications and end up in the hospital. Hospitals and clinics need additional staff to adequately treat these extra patients. The medical staffing agency provides this temporary staff.</p>
</p>b. Goal:  Help the medical staffing agency to determine when to send temporary staff to each hospital in the 51 states in United States.</p>
</p>e. Stakeholder: CareerFoundry Data Analyst Course, Medical agency frontline staff (nurses, physician assistants, and doctors), the Hospitals and clinics using the staffing agency’s services and the Influenza patients.</p>
</p>f. Tools used: Excel, Microsoft Word, PDF, Tableau.</p>
</p>The medical staffing agency covers all hospitals in each of the states of the United States, and the project will plan for the upcoming influenza season. Using the data on Influenza deaths and   population census, we are to determine when to send staff to each state and the numbers that will be sent. To achieve this purpose, we need to answer the following clarifying questions.</p>
</p>a. Clarifying questions:</p>
</p>* How can the data provided give information to support a staffing plan, the timing and spatial distribution of medical personnel throughout the United States?</p>
</p>* Determine whether influenza occurs seasonally or throughout the entire year. If seasonal, does it start and end at the same time (month) in every state?</p>
</p>* While prioritizing states with large vulnerable populations. How can each state be categorized as low-, medium-, or high-need based on its vulnerable population count?</p>
</p>*  Do deaths vary by state or is it consistent with vulnerable population assumption?</p>
</p>* Which states have higher incidence of the flu?</p>
</p>b. Hypothesis</p>
</p>* If states with higher mortality rate due to flu receives more medical resources, then mortality rate due to flu will decrease.</p>
</p>* If the hospitals are sent more medical staff at the high flu season, then mortality rate due to flu will decrease.</p>
</p>3. Sourcing and preparing the data</p>
</p>a. Sourcing data</p>
</p>The following data used can be found on the United States government website and its freely access by all.</p>
</p>•	 Influenza deaths by geography, time, age, and gender
Source: CDC   https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/zcxoalk6ekfxkfd93al9j/CDC_Influenza_Deaths_edited.xlsx?dl=0&rlkey=he9pea3yuot8s40xfu8chv6v4</p>
</p>•	Population data by geography
Source: US Census Bureau    https://www.dropbox.com/s/oz45uemoekbir7p/Census_Population_transformed_202101.csv?dl=0</p>
</p>b. Preparing data</p>
</p>In Excel, the data was:</p>
</p>Cleaned- As elaborated in section 5, Project reflection, some of the data were cleaned by taking educated guesses, some were inputted with an average, while the others remained as they were.</p>
</p>Transformed- For both Influenza Deaths data and Population Data the counties for each state were merged into states, the months of the years were transformed into each year and the less than one year and 1 to 4 years under Ten-Year Age Groups column was merged.</p>
</p>Integrated- Both Influenza Deaths data and Population Data were merged as one data to achieve the results of this project.</p>
</p>Summarized- The summarized data is used to determine the integrity and authenticity of the data. This is elaborated in section 4, under Statistical analysis.</p>
</p>4. Statistical and visual analysis</p>

</p>a. Statistical analysis</p>
</p>I started the project by cleaning and organizing the datasets before merging everything to final dataset.</p>		
</p>1.	Clean “orders” dataset</p>
</p>2.	Clean “Products” dataset</p>
</p>3.	Transponder Departments dataset</p>
</p>4.	Clean “customers” dataset</p>
</p>5.	Merge everything together</p>
</p>6.	Column derivations and aggregations to answer Sales and Marketing questions</p>
</p>Statistical analysis is very important in any data analysis project. It helps to determine the integrity and authenticity of the data used for the project. From the data obtained, the math conducted in the analysis, reveals there is a strong correlation between vulnerable population of 85 years and above, and the number of deaths reported for vulnerable population of 85 years and above. The comparisons of the two variables both resulted in a correlation of 0.910691187309693 signifying a strong correlation between the two variables. It means if population of 85 years and above increases, death of 85 years and above also increases. The following is a breakdown of mean and standard deviation for the two variables:</p>
</p>Flu Deaths of 85 years and above:</p>
</p>Mean- 552</p>
</p>Standard Deviation- 498</p>
</p>Census of 85 years and above:</p>
</p>Mean- 107, 965</p>
</p>Standard Deviation- 122, 245</p>

<p>
</p>Insights</p>		
</p>Null Hypothesis:</p>

</p>* The mortality rate from influenza of vulnerable groups is equal to or less than mortality rate from non-vulnerable groups.</p>
</p>Alternative Hypothesis:</p>
</p>* The mortality rate from influenza of vulnerable groups is more than mortality rate from non-vulnerable groups.</p>
</p>Findings:</p>
</p>Using a standard level of significance of 0.05 to conduct statistical analysis and finding a p-value of 7.121247E-24, we can reject the Null Hypothesis and accept the Alternative Hypothesis. With 95% confidence, this confirms that the mortality rate from influenza of vulnerable groups is more than mortality rate from non-vulnerable groups. </p>
</p>b. Visual analysis</p>
</p>For presentation to our stakeholders, visualization is necessary for better interpretation.</p>

</p>The above indicates the top seven states (California, New York, Texas, Pennsylvania, Florida, Illinois, and Ohio) with influenza deaths. It shows that vulnerable deaths are more than non- vulnerable in the states.</p>
<p>5. Project reflection</p>
	<p>Influenza Deaths- There are 5, 508 missing values under Ten-Year Age Groups column that were coded as 'Not Stated', which is 8.33% of the values under this group. The approach of 'Do nothing' was taken because removing the records/variables or imputing central tendency/random values does not work here as the missing data makes up for more than 5% of the total values within the data set and this could affect the data integrity. </p>
</p>There are 54, 013 missing values under Deaths column that were coded as 'Suppressed'. These accounts for 81.72% of the values under this group. Because the percentage is very high, I replaced the ‘Suppressed' values with the average (34) of the available data, in other to keep the data integrity.</p>
<p>Population Data- Some of the county’s names in the state of Puerto Rico (PR)-were misspelled as: 1. A?asco. 2. Bayam?n 3. Can?vanas 4. Cata?o 5. Comer?o 6. Gu·nica 7. Juana D?az 8. Lo?za 9. Manat? 10. Mayag?ez  11. Pe?uelas 12. R?o Grande 13. Rinc?n 14. San Germ·n 15.San Sebasti·n Municipios. With educated guesses, these were corrected as follows: 1.Anasco 2.Bayamon 3. Canovanas 4. Catano 5. Comerio 6. Guanica 7. Juana Diaz 8. Loiza 9. Manati 10.Mayaguez 11.Penuelas 12.Rio Grande 13.Rincon 14.San German 15. San Sebastian Municipios</p>
</p>A total of 1647 values are blank under the Year column from 2009 to 2017. This accounts for 9.33% of the values. The approach of 'Do nothing' was taken because removing the records/variables or imputing central tendency/random values does not work here as the missing data makes up for more than 5% of the total values within the data set and this could affect the data integrity.</p>
</p>6. Recommendations</p>
<p>According to the season forecast for influenza, winter and spring seasons will continue to be the most affected seasons. </p>
<p>Also, it has been established that the mortality rate from influenza of vulnerable groups is more than the mortality rate from the non-vulnerable groups; more medical staff should be deployed to the states that has more vulnerable groups. Also, each state with different rate of vulnerable groups should be grouped into either red alert or green alert zones so that more focus will be on the red alert zones.</p>
<p>We will recommend that these 7 states- California, New York, Texas, Pennsylvania, Florida, Illinois, and Ohio should be the first focus of the medical staffing agency during the seasons of winter and spring. </p>
</p>We will also recommend that everyone, especially the vulnerable population, be given vaccine.</p>

					</p>Preparing for Influenza Season</p>
				</p>•	Conducted an analysis for the Medical Staffing Agency to identify which USA States had the most vulnerable influenza population (highest rate of influenza death,) and determined peak influenza seasons to allocate medical staff to states that needed more support. The data used was gathered from year 2009 to 2017. </p>
			</p>•	It was determined that the highest priority (based on influenza deaths) were California, New York, Texas, Pennsylvania, Florida, Illinois, Ohio, with winter as the peak period, therefore, more medical staff will be sent to those states during this period.</p>
		</p>•	Excel was used to query, filter, summarize, clean, and analyze the data, while Tableau was used to visualize the data.</p>
	</p>•	Rockbuster Stealth online video rental service analysis project</p>
	</p>•	Conducted an analysis for Rockbuster Stealth LLC who is a movie rental company with stores around the world, now facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime. The analysis identified the countries that had the highest sales and movies that contributed the most gain, to launch an online video rental service to stay competitive. 
	</p>•	It was determined that the top five countries based on sales and lifetime value base are India, China, Japan, Mexico, and United States and the top five movies that contributed the most gain based on revenue generated are Telegraph Voyage, Zorro Ark, Wife Turn, Innocent Usual and Hustler Party.</p>
	</p>•	The data was queried, filtered, summarized, cleaned, and analyzed using MySQL and visualized, using Tableau.</p>
